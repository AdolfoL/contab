    <P>They are all those costs that are not of production; that is, they can not be assigned to the product in a specific way, so they are distributed according to the object of costs.
    Its existence is as real as that of production costs; the consumer is the one who pays them in the end. An expensive distribution makes the product more expensive.
    Distribution begins from the moment the items are delivered to the finished goods warehouse and ends at the time the payment is received for the item sold.</P>
